            At 2 months old, your baby is beginning to develop more predictable sleep patterns. Most 2-month-olds 
            need 14-17 hours of sleep per 24-hour period, including 4-6 naps during the day.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Wake windows for 2-month-olds are typically 60-90 minutes. This means your baby should be put down 
            for a nap within this timeframe to prevent overtiredness. A typical day might include 4-5 naps 
            ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours each.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Remember that every baby develops at their own pace. Some 2-month-olds may still have very irregular 
            schedules, while others might start showing more consistent patterns. Focus on following your baby's 
            sleep cues rather than forcing a rigid schedule.
