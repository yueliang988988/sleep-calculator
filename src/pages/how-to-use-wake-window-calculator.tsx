            Our wake window calculator helps you determine the optimal times for naps and bedtime based on 
            your baby's age and last wake time. Simply enter your baby's age in months and the time they 
            last woke up to get personalized recommendations.

            The calculator uses evidence-based wake window guidelines that account for your child's 
            developmental stage. It calculates the ideal next nap time and bedtime to prevent overtiredness 
            while ensuring adequate awake time for healthy sleep pressure to build.

            Remember that these are guidelines, not rigid rules. Every baby is different, and factors like 
            growth spurts, illness, or developmental leaps can affect sleep needs. Use the calculator as 
            a starting point and adjust based on your child's individual sleep cues and patterns.
