            Nap transitions are major milestones in your child's sleep development. These typically occur 
            around 4 months (5â†’4 naps), 6-8 months (4â†’3 naps), 12-18 months (3â†’2 naps), and 2.5-4 years 
            (2â†’1 nap or dropping naps entirely).
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Signs your child is ready for a nap transition include consistently refusing one nap, taking 
            longer to fall asleep, shorter naps, or early morning wake-ups. The transition period usually 
            lasts 2-4 weeks and requires gradually adjusting wake windows and nap times.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            During transitions, be flexible and patient. Some days your child might need the old schedule, 
            while others they'll handle the new one. Gradually extend wake windows by 15-30 minutes and 
            watch for overtiredness cues to ensure a smooth transition.
