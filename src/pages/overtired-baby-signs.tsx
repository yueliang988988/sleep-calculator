            Recognizing the signs of an overtired baby is essential for maintaining healthy sleep patterns. 
            When babies stay awake too long, their bodies produce stress hormones that make it harder to fall 
            asleep and stay asleep.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Common signs include excessive crying or fussiness, difficulty settling down, hyperactivity or 
            appearing "wired," rubbing eyes or face, yawning frequently, and becoming clingy or demanding. 
            Some babies may also arch their backs, have trouble feeding, or wake frequently during sleep.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Prevention is key! Watch for early tired cues like decreased activity, staring into space, 
            or subtle fussiness. Acting on these early signs and following age-appropriate wake windows 
            can help prevent overtiredness and promote better sleep for the whole family.
