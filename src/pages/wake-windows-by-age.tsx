            Understanding wake windows by age is crucial for establishing healthy sleep patterns for your baby. 
            Wake windows are the periods when your baby should be awake between sleep periods, and they gradually 
            increase as your child grows.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Newborns (0-2 months) typically have very short wake windows of 45-90 minutes, while toddlers 
            (2+ years) can stay awake for 5-6 hours between naps. Following age-appropriate wake windows 
            helps prevent overtiredness and promotes better sleep quality.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Every baby is unique, so use these guidelines as a starting point and adjust based on your 
            child's individual needs and sleep cues. Signs of tiredness include rubbing eyes, yawning, 
            fussiness, and decreased activity.
